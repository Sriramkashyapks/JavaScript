# ES6 / ES2015

# Destructing Assignment

used to Extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables easliy

```jsx
// for arrays 

const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; // initializing the array
const [a, b, c] =  numbers; //destructing assignments for arrays

// for arrays => [..] 

// printing the array
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2
console.log(c); // 3

// for objects
const obj = {       //initializing the objects
name: 'Thatcher',
age: 21,
gender: "M"
};

//destruction assignment
const {name, age, gender} = obj;    //const [name, age, gender] = objects; -> wrong

// for objects = {..}

console.log(name); // Thatcher
console.log(age); // 21 
console.log(gender); // M
```

# Functions and Arrow Fuunctions

## Functions:

- Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
- They allow you to group code together and execute it whenever needed.
- Functions can take input values called parameters, perform operations, and return a result.
- They are a fundamental building block in JavaScript programming and are used to organize and modularize code.

## Arrow Functions:

- rep by “⇒”
- use → to make the function clear, concise, readable

```jsx    
//EXAMPLE 1

function add(a, b){
    return a+b;
}

console.log(add(5,10)); //15
// here I'm calling the function explicitly and passing the arguments w.r.t the parameters

// Arrow function
const sub = (a,b) => a - b;

console.log(sub(31,20)); //11
// here compared to the function the arrow function is clear consize and simple

//EXAMPLE 2

const hello = () => {
    return "Hello World!";
}

console.log(hello());

//arrow function

const namaste = () => "Namaste Vishwam";

console.log(namaste) //[Function: namaste] -> wrong
console.log(namaste()) // Namaste Vishwam
```

# Classes and Inheritance:

- classes are used to create objects and to create objects we use constructors
- Inheritance is used to inherit the properties of the parent class to the child class

```jsx
//Parent class
class Animal {
    constructor(name){
        this.name = name;
    } //creating a constructor

    eat(){
        console.log(`${this.name} is eating`);;
    }
    //this keyword is used to refer to current object
}

//child class inheriting from parent class Animal

class Dog extends Animal{
    constructor(name, breed){
        super(name);
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    bark() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is barking`);
    }
}

const animal = new Animal('lion');
animal.eat();

const dog = new Dog("Buddy", "Pitbull");
dog.eat();
dog.bark();

```

# Template Literals

- Template literals are a new feature in JavaScript that allow you to create multiline strings and embed expressions in strings.
- This makes it easier to write code that is both readable and maintainable.

```jsx
//Example 1
const name = "Alice";
const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(message); //Hello Alice!

//Example 2
// this exaple is to show the embedding the value of the name variable
const age = 25;
const message = `Alice is ${age} years old.`;
console.log(message); // Alice is 25 years old.

//both int and strings can be used in template literals
```

# Spread or rest operator

## Spread operator:

- Spread operator is represented by `(’ … ‘)`
- An array or String elements can be expanded by using spread operator.
- Indefinite number of aruguments as an array or objects can be expanded.

```jsx
// spread operator is used to expand the elements of an array or object

//Spread operator for arrays
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const moreNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 5, 6];
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(moreNumbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> arrays are expanded

//Spread operator for objects
const person = {
    name: 'Thatcher',
    age: 21,
};
const morePerson = {
    ...person,
    birthYear: 1999,
};
console.log(person); // { name: 'Thatcher', age: 21 }
console.log(morePerson); // { name: 'Thatcher', age: 21, birthYear: 1999 } ->   objects are expanded
```

## Rest Operator:

- rest operator is used to collect the remaining arguments into an array
- rest operator is used in the function parameter
- rest operator is used to collect the remaining arguments into an array

```

function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // 15

```
