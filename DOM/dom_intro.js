// DOM is a tree structure of HTML elements
// The root of the tree is the document object
// The document object is the owner of all other objects in your web page
// With the DOM, developers can:

// Access any element in the document and modify its content, attributes, and styles.
// Add or remove elements and attributes dynamically.
// Respond to user events such as clicks and keystrokes.
// Update the document based on user interactions or data from external sources.
